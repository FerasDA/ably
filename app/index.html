            This application uses Netlify serverless functions to host an API, and a plain HTML application to render the response.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're using the Netlify serverless function to manage an Ably API Key - there is a tokenRequest API that serves on /.netlify/functions/ably-tokenRequest that provides
            the in-browser SDK with your API key.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once this page loads, it'll connect to an ably channel, and send a message - the raw messages will appear below:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="response">
        <h2>Ably messages will append here.</h2>
    </div>
</body>
